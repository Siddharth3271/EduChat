Experience
Salesforce Developer Intern (Virtual Internship) May 2025 – July 2025
Salesforce Developer Remote
•Developed WhatNext Vision Motors - Salesforce CRM App, a cloud based Solution for vehicle Management using
Apex and Lightning Web Components (LWC).
•Automated business processes and optimized data models using declarative tools, improving workﬂow eﬃciency
and system responsiveness.
Projects
Airline-Passenger-Reﬀeral-Prediction |Machine Learning, Scikit-learn, Classiﬁcation, Gradio
•Built and deployed a classiﬁcation model to predict whether a passenger will refer the airline to others, addressing a
critical business need to improve customer satisfaction and increase referral rates by 20% based on prediction
analysis.
•Validated model robustness through cross-validation, conﬁrming stable performance with only a 0.02% diﬀerence in
misclassiﬁcations compared to a single train-test split.
•Generated a model accuracy of 94% using Logistic Regression and a precision score of 94% for the positive class.
Advanced-Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis |Clustering, NLP, Scikit-learn, Sentiment Analysis
•Developed a clustering model for Zomato restaurants based on reviews and features, allowing the identiﬁcation of
diﬀerent restaurant segments and assisting in strategic marketing decisions.
•Faced challenges in text preprocessin g for sentiment analysis, conducted feature engineering for clustering and
reduced dimensionality by 90% using PCA for better visualization.
•Achieved an ROC AUC score of 0.921 with an XGBoost classiﬁer , and obtained 86% accuracy for sentiment
classiﬁcation.
ChatBot-Using-Deep-Learning |Keras, TensorFlow, Sequence Modeling , LSTM
•Built and ﬁne-tuned an LSTM-based chatbot to handle natural language queries, enhancing user interaction and
automating customer support responses.
•Encountered challenges in managing long sequences, performed extensive text preprocessing, and used padding and
tokenization techniques to handle variable-length inputs.
•Implemented the model with TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing pre-trained embeddings to improve contextual
understanding of responses, leading to a 25% improvement in response relevance.
•Achieved a validation accuracy of 90% demonstrating a well trained language model for conversational AI.
