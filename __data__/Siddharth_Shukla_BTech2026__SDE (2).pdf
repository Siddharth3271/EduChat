Projects
Airline-Passenger-Reﬀeral-Prediction |Machine Learning, Scikit-learn, Classiﬁcation, Gradio
•Built and deployed a classiﬁcation model to predict whether a passenger will refer the airline to others, addressing a
critical business need for improving customer satisfaction and retention.
•Validated model robustness through cross-validation, conﬁrming stable performance with only a 0.02% diﬀerence in
misclassiﬁcations compared to a single train-test split.
•Generated a model accuracy of 94% using Logistic Regression and a precision score of 94% for the positive class.
•Deployed the model using Gradio , allowing for interactive testing and feedback from business users, with a potential
to increase referral rates by 20% based on prediction analysis.
Mini-Compiler |C/C++, Lex, Abstract Syntax Tree, Bison
•Engineered a custom compiler for Scriptura, a beginner-friendly programming language designed from scratch,
successfully implementing lexical analysis and parsing.
•Utilized Lex and an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to manage the parsing logic and intermediate code representation.
Full-Stack-Expense-Tracker |Spring Boot, Java FX, CSS, SQL
•Designed a desktop application with 15+ JavaFX UI components, integrating with a Spring Boot backend to develop
and consume over 15 REST APIs for user authentication and full CRUD operations on expense and income data.
•Integrated data visualization components to generate a dynamic chart of monthly income and expenses, improving
user data analysis by 40%.
•Automated the calculation of total income and expenses for the entire year, eliminating 30% of time for manual data
processing by users.
Advanced-Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis |Clustering, NLP, Scikit-learn, Sentiment Analysis
•Developed a clustering model for Zomato restaurants based on reviews and features, allowing the identiﬁcation of
diﬀerent restaurant segments and assisting in strategic marketing decisions.
•Faced challenges in text preprocessin g for sentiment analysis, conducted feature engineering for clustering and
reduced dimensionality by 90% using PCA for better visualization.
•Achieved an ROC AUC score of 0.921 with an XGBoost classiﬁer , and obtained 86% accuracy for sentiment
classiﬁcation.
